# Python development headers

This folder contains copies of the verbatim Python C headers, versioned as per folder name. The license of these files are explained in LICENSE.

pyconfig.h is my attempt at creating a minimal and as widely compatible configuration as possible for the platform Intel x64 (Linux). Maybe we will need one pyconfig per platform, I don't know.
